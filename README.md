# DFN Discount App - 50% Discount Function

A Shopify app that provides a powerful 50% discount function for e-commerce stores. This app allows store owners to easily apply 50% discounts to orders or individual products using Shopify's discount function API.

##  Features

- **50% Order Discount**: Apply 50% off to entire orders
- **50% Product Discount**: Apply 50% off to individual cart line items
- **Flexible Discount Classes**: Supports both Order and Product discount classes
- **Multiple Cart Lines**: Automatically applies discounts to all cart items
- **Smart Integration**: Works seamlessly with Shopify's existing discount system

##  How It Works

The discount function (`cart_lines_discounts_generate_run`) processes cart input and generates discount operations based on the configured discount classes:

1. **Order Discount Class**: Creates a single 50% discount on the entire order
2. **Product Discount Class**: Creates individual 50% discounts for each cart line item
3. **Combined**: Both discounts can be applied simultaneously

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Frontend**: React with Shopify Polaris components
- **Extension**: Shopify Function (TypeScript)
- **Build Tools**: Vite, Shopify CLI
- **Package Manager**: npm

   cd ../../extensions/discount-function && npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the app**
   ```bash

   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Building & Deployment

1. **Build the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd web/frontend
   SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key npm run build
   ```

2. **Build the function**

   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy the app**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

##  Usage

### Method 1: Manual Discount Creation (Shopify Admin)

1. Deploy the app to your Shopify store
2. In your Shopify admin, go to **Discounts**
3. Click **"Create discount"**
4. Select **"Function-based discount"**
5. Choose this app's discount function
6. Configure discount classes (Order, Product, or both)
7. Set conditions and restrictions as needed
8. Activate the discount

### Method 2: Programmatic Discount Creation (GraphiQL)

For advanced users who want to create discounts programmatically using the Shopify Admin API:

#### Step 1: Open GraphiQL Interface

1. Start your Shopify app in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In the terminal where your app is running, press **`g`** to open the GraphiQL interface

3. Select the latest stable API version in the GraphiQL interface

#### Step 2: Get Your Function ID

Run this query in GraphiQL to get your function ID:

```graphql
query {
  shopifyFunctions(first: 25) {
    nodes {
      app {
        title
      }
      apiType
      title
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Copy the `id` value from the response. It will look like: `gid://shopify/Function/123456789`

#### Step 3: Create the Discount

Use this mutation to create an automatic app discount:

```graphql
mutation {
  discountAutomaticAppCreate(
    automaticAppDiscount: {
      title: "Cart line, Order, Shipping discount"
      functionId: "YOUR_FUNCTION_ID_HERE"
      discountClasses: [PRODUCT, ORDER, SHIPPING]
      startsAt: "2025-01-01T00:00:00"
    }
  ) {
    automaticAppDiscount {
      discountId
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `YOUR_FUNCTION_ID_HERE` with the actual function ID from Step 2.

#### Step 4: Verify Success

If successful, you'll receive a response like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "discountAutomaticAppCreate": {
      "automaticAppDiscount": {
        "discountId": "gid://shopify/DiscountAutomaticNode/123456789"
      },
      "userErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Method 3: Using the App Interface

The app also provides a user-friendly interface for:
- Getting function IDs automatically
- Creating discounts with custom configurations
- Testing discount functionality
- Debugging function behavior

Navigate to the app's main interface and use the "Quick Setup" section for automated discount creation.

### Discount Classes

- **Order**: Applies 50% to entire order subtotal
- **Product**: Applies 50% to each cart line item individually
- **Both**: Applies both types of discounts

##  Configuration

The app automatically detects the discount classes configured in your Shopify discount and applies the appropriate logic:

- If only `Order` class is selected: 50% off entire order
- If only `Product` class is selected: 50% off each item
- If both classes are selected: Both discounts are applied

##  Testing

### Function Testing

cd extensions/discount-function
npm test
```

### Frontend Testing

```bash
cd web/frontend
npm test
```

##  Deployment

### Development

```bash

##  Troubleshooting

### GraphiQL Issues

**GraphiQL won't open:**
- Make sure your app is running in development mode (`npm run dev`)
- Ensure you're pressing `g` in the correct terminal window
- Check that you're logged into the correct Shopify store

**Authentication errors:**
- Verify you're logged into the correct Shopify store in your browser
- Check that your app has the necessary permissions
- Ensure your app is properly installed on the store

**Function not found:**
- Verify your function is properly deployed
- Check that the app is installed on the store
- Ensure you're using the correct function ID

**Invalid function ID:**
- Double-check the ID format (should start with `gid://shopify/Function/`)
- Make sure you're copying the ID from the correct function
- Verify the function belongs to your app

### Common Error Messages

**"Function not found" error:**
```json
{
  "userErrors": [
    {
      "field": ["functionId"],
      "message": "Function not found"
    }
  ]
}
```
This usually means the function ID is incorrect or the function isn't properly deployed.

**"Permission denied" error:**
Make sure your app has the `write_discounts` permission and is properly installed on the store.
